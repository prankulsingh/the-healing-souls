Hello everyone,

I'm **Vishakha Singh**, psychologist and founder of *The Healing Souls*. Today, I want to talk about a topic that comes up often in my sessions and in everyday life: **setting boundaries**—and doing so **without guilt**.

## Why Boundaries Matter

Boundaries are not walls. They are **healthy limits** that protect our time, energy, and emotional well-being. They help define what is acceptable for us and ensure that we are respecting ourselves as much as we respect others.

When we set boundaries, we’re not being selfish—we’re being **self-aware**.

## Common Myths About Boundaries

Many people struggle with guilt because of common myths like:

- "Saying no makes me a bad person."
- "If I set limits, people will leave me."
- "I should always be available for the people I care about."

These beliefs often stem from past conditioning or fear of rejection. But the truth is, **you can be kind and still say no**.

## How to Set Boundaries Without Guilt

Here are a few gentle but firm ways to begin setting boundaries:

1. **Get clear on your needs.**
Ask yourself: *What drains me? What do I need more of? What feels respectful to me?*

2. **Use “I” statements.**
For example: “I need some time to recharge this evening, so I won’t be able to talk right now.”

3. **Start small.**
Begin with one area of your life—perhaps with a friend, at work, or even in your family.

4. **Remember: Guilt is not a signal of wrongdoing.**
Feeling guilty doesn’t mean you’re doing something wrong. It often just means you’re doing something new.

## A Loving Reminder

You are allowed to have limits. You are allowed to protect your peace. And you are still a good, caring person when you do.

If no one has told you this lately: **you don’t have to earn rest, space, or respect. You deserve it just as you are.**

With care and compassion,
**Vishakha Singh**
